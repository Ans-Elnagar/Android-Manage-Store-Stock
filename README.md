# Android-Manage-Store-Stock
The application is implemented in java.\
This is the first version of the app <s>and I might use fragments in the second version</s>.\
```The app is being re-written and improved with React-native with support of syncronizing the data using a back-end Node.js server and a MongoDB database. With a lot of other features.```
# Current features:
  - Save products into different categories.
  - To edit a product, enter its code. you can open View Store and press
    on any product code and it will be copied to phone clipboard.
  - View store for specific category.
  - You can enter a category and select some product then go to another 
    category to select more and the app will add all of them to the same
    bill.
  - Data is saved on phone external storage. So it won't be deleted if
    the app is uninstalled by mistake.
